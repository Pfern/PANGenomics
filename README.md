# PANGenomics

Course under development for the GTPB programme

## TODO

Pedro's suggestions:

- Define the overall learning objectives
- Break down in units (sub-objectives) that can be assigned to instructors
- Identify learning outcomes for each unit.
- For each outcome design an exercise
- For each exercise identify the short lecture needed and the materials
- Compose a schedule, spreading moments of wrap-up, feedback, Q&A, etc.
