The MHC (major histocompatiblity complex) is a region on chromosome 6 in the human genome. It is enriched for  genes of the immune system, including the HLA (human leukocyte antigen) genes, which are part of the adaptive immune system. Unlike antibodies, the HLA genes do not undergo somatic mutation or rearrangement. However, they do display antigen to antibodies and T-cell receptors. These genes are under strong diversifying selection; any haplotype that becomes too common is susceptible to epidemic if a disease agent evolves the capacity to evade it. For this reason, the MHC region is one of the most wildly polymorphic regions of the human genome. Moreover, it is enriched for non-trivial structural variation as well as point variants.

Because the MHC region is so polymorphic, it is one of the regions of the human genome that is not well-served by linear references. Recognizing this limitation, starting with with GRCh38 the Genome Reference Consortium began distributing a set of alternate scaffolds for the MHC (and some other regions) along with the reference sequence. However,
